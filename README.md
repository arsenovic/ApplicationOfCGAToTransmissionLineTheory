This module provides code used to compute and verify the results in the paper, "Applications of Conformal Geometric Algebra to Transmission Line Theory", by Alex Arsenovic. The  symbolic geometric algebra module  `galgebra` is used to support some derivations in SymbolicComputations. The numerical geometric algebra `clifford` is ued to  verify  the results with conventional results.
